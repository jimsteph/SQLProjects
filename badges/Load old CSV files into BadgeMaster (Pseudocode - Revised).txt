Create a file named BigList (Active, RFID, StudentID, DateAdded, DateDropped)


For each CSV file in ascending (by date) order:
    In BigList set Active to False for all records
    For each line in CSVFile do:
        Read RFID, StudentID
        If RFID = "RFID" continue       # it's a header
        If len(StudentID) = 7:          # dupes would be eight or more characters 
                                        #   in length
            If RFID not in BigList:
                Add Active=True, RFID, StudentID, Date from File Name,
                and DateDropped=null to BigList
            If RFID in BigList:
                Set Active=True
                If DateDropped is not null    # It was inactive if this is true
                    DateDropped = null
                    DateAdded = FileDate
